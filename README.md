- ***Heartbeat is the best music***. If u tend to listen to your heart, automatically the upcoming way for our career will be cleared of the obstacles of confusion and doubts.

There was a complete mismatch in the opening of eyes of all the individuals. All this was just because everyone used their share of 60 seconds according to themselves.

| 17-07-2024 | Pf. Jasmine Kaur | Human as a co-existence of self and body |

### ***In her lecture, professor jasmine laid stress on the following things:-*** ###
**The ultimate difference between body and self**
- Body can be touched while self can only be felt
- Self itself means soul
- The needs of self are:- **respect**, **love**, **glory**, **reverence**, **gratitude** etc
- These needs are required to be fulfilled for achieving happiness
- Needs of self are continous while needs of body are discontinous
- It is because for example wind is a bodily need and is required only during summers and monsoons. In winters its need is not appreciated at all while respect is the need of self 
  which is demanded despite any age, colour, gender, status, weather or any other factor
- Needs of self are qualitative while needs of body are quantitative
- Needs of self are fulfilled by right understanding and right feeling while needs of body are fulfilled by physio-chemical things
- Desires, thoughts and expectations are activities of self while walking, eating, sleeping etc are activities of body
- Body activities are recognised by both us and our self and are thus fulfilled while activities of self are recognised by us and are thus fulfilled in 4 steps:-
                    1. Knowing         2. Assuming         3. Recognizing          4. Fulfilling 
- The only mistake of self is its assuming without knowing. If person is understood correctly, then assumptions are made right and hence fulfillment is done easily
- Self is the domain of conscience while body is the domain of materialistic things
- Desires, thoughts and expectations together make up our imagination
- Preconditioning, Sensation and Natural acceptance affect our imagination

| 18-07-2024 | Pf. Jasmine Kaur | Understanding Harmony in the Family |

- From family onwards, we acquire relationships between one person and another
- Relationship is a thing between one self and other self
- After home, we build (not acquire) relationships and feelings with friends, teachers etc.
- To develop a good relationship, we need to know the meanings of feelings
- **There are 9 types of feelings:-**
1. Trust
2. Respect
3. Affection
4. Care
5. Guidance
6. Reverence
7. Glory
8. Gratitude
9. Love

- Trust builds when person has intent to make you prosperous and happy
- You had intention to make someone happy but due to  circumstances you fail, then also there can be considered trust
- We want to keep ourself happy but if by chance we are unable, then we cannot keep other person happy as well. So trust issues arise
- Disrespect can be measured as if a person is being buttered or he/she is underdescribed
- Treating someone as animal is called otherwise evaluation and it is also a disrespect
- If both the person's purpose or program is same, respect generates
- Program is like understanding harmony
- If we understand that both our potentials like desire, thought and expectation, respect comes
- If we discriminate a person on the basis of age, physical attributes, physical strength, physical property etc. then we are disrespecting that person
- We should understand that we are complementary to each other i.e respect is complementary
- If we can correct someone's competence with our right understanding then the same can happen with us as well
