### Sir delivered their golden words by listing all the folowing ideals:- ###
- The role of **DESTINY** in shaping one's life completely from an aimless life to a one with a good purpose and make ourselves realise that yes life is worth living.
- The fundamental rule of **CHANGING** and **GROWING**.
- "Only me and myself can help in changing and growing myself" if I am **Determined** enough.
- ***Heartbeat is the best music***. If u tend to listen to your heart, automatically the upcoming way for our career will be cleared of the obstacles of confusion and doubts.
- Sir also talked about the negative perception of the people of punjab in doing any work. The downgraded **Self Esteem** of the people here have ruined their ability of learning new skills which has lead the youth towards taking the career choices against their will resulting in poor results and researches.
- The only way to learn something new and succeed in it is to **" Believe in Yourself"**
- The word **Motivation** itself contains the letter **"I"** in it.
- Our **Inner Voice** is the pushing force for us in doing any productive work and contribute towards the betterment of the society.
- **The Concept of 1 minute Silence**- Everyone was asked to close their eyes and remain silent of 1 minute and after that they could open their eyes. There was a complete mismatch in the opening of eyes of all the individuals. All this was just because everyone used their share of 60 seconds according to themselves. Some wasted their seconds to open eyes quickly whereas some students completely utilised their time in keeping their eyes closed. This showed the concept of **Time Management** amongst people.
